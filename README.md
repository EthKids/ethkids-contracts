# ethkids-contracts
This repo contains the contracts for the EthKids https://ethkids.io/ protocol.
In order to deploy to the network, two files in the root folder are required (not included in the repo):
- .mnemonicRinkeby with the owner's mnemonic for deployment to the Rinkeby network
- .mnemonicMain registry's owner for Main net

This is fully open source and non-commercial solution, hence open for ideas, contributions and support!

Truffle migration script rolls over the CommunityRegistry and one donation community.
